# FramerateHandler
> A Project to showcase constant updates

## Description

A Framerate Handler that is mostly seen in Games. Games have to provide the user with a smooth gaming experience. Normal while loops run too fast and inconsistently. By using an update loop that runs every second 60 Times, the game runs smoothly and reduces cpu usage.

## ShowCase

## Features
* **Automatic FPS** ``(Automatically fetches framerate of main monitor)``
* **CPU usage friendly** ``(uses Thread.sleep for managing game loop)``
* **Latency Handling** ``(Tries to keep the FPS high even under latency/lag)``
* **Constant UPS** ``(Updates per second allow for smooth and consistent updates on any system)``
